⛔ DEPRECATED. This example demonstrated how to implement the cell merge feature for the ASPxGridView control. Starting with v16.1, this functionality is available out of the box. Set the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridViewBehaviorSettings.AllowCellMerge">ASPxGridView.SettingsBehavior.AllowCellMerge</a> or <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.GridViewDataColumnSettings.AllowCellMerge">GridViewDataColumn.Settings.AllowCellMerge</a> property to `True` to activate it.

You can try this functionality in the following online demo:
